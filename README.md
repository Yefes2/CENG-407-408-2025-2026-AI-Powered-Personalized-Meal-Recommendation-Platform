# CENG-407-408-2025-2026-AI-Powered-Personalized-Meal-Recommendation-Platform

This project aims to develop a web-based application that provides personalized meal recommendations based on users’ available ingredients, dietary preferences, and taste profiles.
Users will be able to specify their favorite and disliked foods, as well as their nutrition goals such as weight loss or vegetarian diets. The system will use AI-based recommendation algorithms to analyze these inputs and generate personalized meal suggestions.

Additionally, users can enter the ingredients they currently have, and the system will display recipes that can be prepared with those ingredients. For each recipe, nutritional values such as calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fats will be automatically calculated through a nutrition analysis API.

The project will include modules for user management, recipe database, nutrition API integration, and AI recommendation engine development using modern web technologies. The overall goal is to create a user-friendly and intelligent system that promotes balanced and personalized nutrition.
